# Twitter-Liked-Image-Scraper
A thing I made to scrape funny twitter images

### Setup
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Monikaya/Twitter-Liked-Image-Scraper.git
$ cd Twitter-Liked-Image-Scraper
```
```bash
$ ./venv/bin/activate
OR
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After that, you should just be able to run:
```bash
$ ./main.py
```
If you run into any issues don't hesitate to open an issue!

### Notes
In order to get your "bearer token" you'll need to head over to https://developer.twitter.com and register there.

Pull requests always welcome

If you're having trouble activating the venv on windows try doing activate.ps1 instead of just activate. Should solve it

### TODO
- Possibly make tweepy async, wouldn't really benefit though
